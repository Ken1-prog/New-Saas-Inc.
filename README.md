## Business Profile and Financial Highlights for the year 2024:

New Saas Technology Solutions (NSTS) is a cloud-based software subscription company that serves 155 major corporate customers globally.
The top five customers in 2024 were: Prudential Services, Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, Ford Motor Co., and Wal-Mart.
NSTS ended the year 2024 with a record $72.9 million in net subscription revenue, a 46% increase over the previous year. 

## Key Insights:

* NSTS provides seven major product solutions and two service subscription levels (Standard and Premium). 
The major product offerings are: Artificial Intelligence platform, Business Intelligence software, Core Platform Suite, Customer Service Cloud,
Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud, and Teams Productivity.

* NSTS offers 3 different customer support plans:  Standard (level 1), Premier (level 2), and Signature (level 3). 

* In 2024, the Core Platform Suite generated the largest source of net subscription revenue at 
$15.6 million (or 21% of total company revenue). Business Intelligence software came in second place
with $14.9 million (or 20%) of total company revenue.

A detailed analysis of 2024 subscription revenue transactions revealed additional revenue growth opportunities for the year 2025.

## Opportunity # 1:  
Four specific products have the potential to generate additional revenue in the year 2025.

* 31 customers could benefit from the A.I. Platform and may lead to $1.1 million in incremental revenue in 2025.
* 25 customers could benefit from the Teams Productivity platform and may lead to $1.6 million in additional revenue in 2025.
* 22 customers could benefit from the Sales Cloud platform and may lead to $1.8 million in additional revenue in 2025.
* 16 customers could benefit from the Marketing Cloud platform and may lead to $1.3 million in additional revenue in 2025.

## Opportunity # 2:  
Some customers could benefit by upgrading their customer support level from Standard to Premier. 
The majority of NSTS customers have a subscription to a Premium (level 2) product but only have a Standard (Level 1) customer support plan subscription. 

* If customers upgrade their customer support plan from Standard (Level 1) to Premier (Level 2), incremental
customer support revenue in the range of $391 thousand and $783 thousand could be realized in 2025.
* If customers upgrade their support level to Signature (Level 3), then somewhere between $861 thousand
and $1.7 million in additional revenue could be generated in 2025.

## Recommendations:

* For opportunity # 1, the Sales and Marketing Team should review the detailed report of customers.
   If a successful campaign to cross-sell these products to the current customer base is launched,
   these product cross-sells could lead to $5.8 million in incremental revenue in 2025.
   
* For opportunity # 2, the Sales and Marketing Team should review all customers who have a Premium level subscription product
    but only have a Standard (Level 1) customer support plan.
   If these customers elect to upgrade their support plan levels, an estimated range between $391 thousand (conservative)
   and $1.7 million (optimistic) in additional revenue could be achieved in 2025.
