A detailed analysis of 2024 subscription revenue transactions revealed two additional revenue growth opportunities for the year 2025.

Opportunity # 1:    Four specific products have the potential to generate additional revenue in the year 2025.
In the year 2024, forty-seven customers used the A.I. Platform, seventy-nine used Teams Productivity, ninety-four used Sales Cloud, 
and ninety-five used Marketing Cloud. 
A list was created to identify which set of customers had a subscription to at least one of the three remaining core products offered by New Sass Inc. 
The list contained 2024 customer revenues by product, along with a count of active user licenses for each customer. 

•	Forty-four customers from the list could benefit from the A.I. Platform and may lead to $1.2 million in incremental revenue in 2025. 
•	Fourteen customers could benefit from the Teams Productivity platform and may lead to $896 thousand in additional revenue in 2025.
•	Two customers could benefit from the Sales Cloud platform and may lead to $124 thousand in additional revenue in 2025.
•	Two customers could benefit from the Marketing Cloud platform and may lead to $138 thousand in additional revenue in 2025.

Opportunity # 2:   Some customers could benefit by upgrading their customer support level from Standard to Premier. 
The majority of New Saas Inc. customers have a subscription to a Premium (level 2) product but only have a Standard (Level 1) customer support plan subscription. 
Incremental customer support revenue in between the range of $399 thousand and $799 thousand could be realized in 2025 
if these customers upgrade their customer support plan from Standard (Level 1) to Premier (Level 2). 
If customers upgrade their support level to Signature (Level 3), then somewhere between $878 thousand
and $1.8 million in additional revenue could be generated in 2025.

Recommendations
1. The Sales and Marketing Team should review the detailed report of customers appearing under Opportunity # 1.
   If a successful campaign to cross-sell these products to the current customer base is launched,
   these product cross-sells could lead to $2.4 million in incremental revenue in 2025.
3. For opportunity # 2, the Sales and Marketing Team should review the list of customers who have a Premium level subscription product
    but only have a Standard (Level 1) customer support plan.
   If these customers elect to upgrade their support plan levels, an estimated range between $399 thousand (conservative estimate)
   and $1.8 million (aggressive estimate) in additional revenue could be achieved in 2025.
